                            <p class="mb-0">PUF Overview: PUF stands for Physically Unclonable Functions and aims to use the uniqueness of integrated circuits (ICs) of a device at the microscopic level
                                to generate and authenticate keys. The idea is, even if two people purchased the same device, from the same manufacturer, manufactured just seconds apart,
                                the circuits in those devices still differ just enough to be unique- like a snowflake. We can send signals though these unique ICs, using numerous evaluation techniques,
                                to create unique keys. Once a key has been obtained, we then run a set of many challenges through the PUF to get the same number of unique responses, these are called 
                                Challenge-Response Pairs (CRPs). Since we have the set of unique CRPs, we can use them to authenticate any transaction over the internet. A has the CRPs, B has the key, A sends 
                                B challenges in which they use the key to evaluate, then B sends the responses back to A. If the CRPs match up, then B indeed has the key and is who they say they are.

                            <p>Practiced the Agile Scrum development process with a team of 4 to create a website used by college professors to improve their lecture efficiency.
                                It does this by reading the annotated output of a ML audio analysis algorithm called CAAML (a black box we were provided with from our client). CAAML determines snippets of audio
                               into 1 of 9 categories, some examples being Student Question, Group Work, Instructor Question, and Lecture. Our website organizes lectures by
                               course and courses by term using a mock database in a file system. Upon arrival on a course page, the user is able to toggle through various graphs created using D3.js which were designed to 
                               visualize the way the professor is lecturing for analysis. The user has many controls over these graphs as they were built from scratch to meet our client's requests.

                            <p> A web application where the users input their expenses and see them visually to keep track on the money they've spent. A Firebase REST API is connected which is used for 
                                account sign up and login capabilities, as well as expense adding, deleting, and editing. I'm planning on adding multiple charts 
                                to the logged in users spending habits.

                            <p> Implemented an Android app in which the user inputs what they have in their virtual 'pantry' and recieves a list of recipes from a Volley API call that 
                                they're able to cook at the moment. This app is connected to a database using SQLite for persistent data and has other features like a shopping list, a Google maps API that shows
                                the user the nearest grocery stores, and a camera button for shareable pictures of their creations. In the MVC architecture, I worked primarily on the view and controller. This 
                                was my first full mobile app I've ever worked on so it was a big learning experience for me and helped reinforce my understanding of MVC, dynamically updating pages, and database
                                connection and manipulation.

                            <p> Created a server/client based command line chatroom with a partner using the TCP protocol in C. Once the server is connected, participants or observers can enter the chat room. Participants are able 
                                to send global messages or direct messges to specific participants. Observers tune in by picking a participants username who's already in the chatroom where they can see any direct messages to their
                                participant or any global message. In other words, participants act as the message box of a chatroom and observers act as the viewing box of that participant. This project helped me understand 
                                socket connections, timeout implementations, buffer overflow handling, message handling, the TCP protocol, server/client communication, and forking.

                                This was my first time programming in C so this project helped me learn a lot about how pointers worked, argument parsing, buffer overflow, parent and child processes, 
                                structs, Makefiles, and segmentation faults. It also gave me the opportunity to apply
                                my knowledge of state machines a great deal and was a pivotal turning point in the way I analyzed and solved a problem before putting it into code.

                         <p class="mb-0">I love the outdoors! While outside, I'm usually snowboarding, hiking, or taking pictures of nature stuff. During the warmer seasons,
                             I like camping out with frineds, climbing mountains, or cruising around on a longboard. When forced indoors because of the nasty elements of the PNW,
                            you can find me practicing my chef and guitar skills, and most importantly, the latest technological advancements in the front-end world of web development.
