          I'm a recent Computer Science graduate out of Western Washington University. For the past year, I've been focusing on web development
          through my senior project and other side projects, mainly using HTML/CSS and Javascript... with some PHP. Along with that, I've had the privilege 
          of assisting with research in the hardware security realm, developing software representations using Python. I absolutely loved both of these projects
          because of the amount of problem solving that had to be done.

        <h4>CAAML Web Tool</h4>
        <h6>Practiced the Agile Scrum development process with a team of 4 to create a website used by college professors to improve their lecture efficiency.
                               It does this by reading the annotated output of a ML audio analysis algorithm called CAAML (a black box we were provided with from our client). CAAML determines snippets of audio
                              into 1 of 9 categories, some examples being Student Question, Group Work, Instructor Question, and Lecture. Our website organizes lectures by
                              course and courses by term using a mock database in a file system. Upon arrival on a course page, the user is able to toggle through various graphs created using D3.js which were designed to 
                              visualize the way the professor is lecturing for analysis. The user has many controls over these graphs as they were built from scratch to meet our client's requests.

        <h4>What's For Dinner</h4>
        <h6>Implemented an Android app in which the user inputs what they have in their virtual 'pantry' and recieves a list of recipes from a Volley API call that 
            they're able to cook at the moment. This app is connected to a database using SQLite for persistent data and has other features like a shopping list, a Google maps API that shows
            the user the nearest grocery stores, and a camera button for shareable pictures of their creations. In the MVC architecture, I worked primarily on the view and controller. This 
            was my first full mobile app I've ever worked on so it was a big learning experience for me and helped reinforce my understanding of MVC, dynamically updating pages, and database
            connection and manipulation.

        <h4>TCP Chatroom</h4>
        <h6>Created a server/client based command line chatroom with a partner using the TCP protocol in C. Once the server is connected, participants or observers can enter the chat room. Participants are able 
            to send global messages or direct messges to specific participants. Observers tune in by picking a participants username who's already in the chatroom where they can see any direct messages to their
            participant or any global message. In other words, participants act as the message box of a chatroom and observers act as the viewing box of that participant. This project helped me understand 
            socket connections, timeout implementations, buffer overflow handling, message handling, the TCP protocol, server/client communication, and forking.

        <h4>Deadwood GUI</h4>
        <h6>Worked with a partner on a clickable graphical representation of the board game, Deadwood. We were given XML files which we parsed to obtain all illustrations needed for the game.
            Using JavaFX, we practiced MVC architectural skills, Object Oriented Design and Programming, Class inheritence understanding, Interface knowledge, and game concepts. This was a 
            pain of a project with tight deadlines and workload I had with that class alone. It was my first taste of strict time management which helped me tremendously through the rest of
            my college career.

        <h4>UShell</h4>
        <h6>Implemented a microshell in C that is capable of processing common shell commands like cd, ls, piping, signal interrupts, and expanding environmental variables.
            This was my first time programming in C so this project helped me learn a lot about how pointers worked, argument parsing, buffer overflow, parent and child processes, 
            structs, Makefiles, and segmentation faults. It also gave me the opportunity to apply
            my knowledge of state machines a great deal and was a pivotal turning point in the way I analyzed and solved a problem before putting it into code.

        <p class="mb-0">PUF Overview: PUF stands for Physically Unclonable Functions and aims to use the uniqueness of integrated circuits (ICs) of a device at the microscopic level
          to generate and authenticate keys. The idea is, even if two people purchased the same device, from the same manufacturer, manufactured just seconds apart,
          the circuits in those devices still differ just enough to be unique- like a snowflake. We can send signals though these unique ICs, using numerous evaluation techniques,
          to create unique keys. Once a key has been obtained, we then run a set of many challenges through the PUF to get the same number of unique responses, these are called 
          Challenge-Response Pairs (CRPs). Since we have the set of unique CRPs, we can use them to authenticate any transaction over the internet. A has the CRPs, B has the key, A sends 
          B challenges in which they use the key to evaluate, then B sends the responses back to A. If the CRPs match up, then B indeed has the key and is who they say they are.
